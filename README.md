# HandTrackingProject

Control your system volume using simple hand gestures.  
This project detects the position of two fingers and adjusts the volume based on their distance â€” no physical contact with your device needed.

## Overview  

The application uses **MediaPipe** for hand tracking and **OpenCV-Python** for real-time video processing. By tracking the top points of two fingers, it calculates the distance between them and maps that distance to your system volume level.  

## Features  

- Real-time hand tracking  
- Gesture-based volume control (two-finger pinch/spread)  
- Built with Python  
- Visual feedback of the tracking process  

## Tech Stack  

- [Mediapipe](https://developers.google.com/mediapipe) â€“ real-time hand tracking  
- [OpenCV-Python](https://opencv.org/) â€“ image/video processing

## How It Works  

1. The webcam feed is captured with OpenCV.  
2. MediaPipe detects and tracks the userâ€™s hand landmarks in real time.  
3. The distance between two selected fingertips is calculated.  
4. This distance is mapped to system volume using a linear interpolation.
